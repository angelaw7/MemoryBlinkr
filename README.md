# MemoryBlinkr
Ever wanted to challenge your memory? Or maybe improve it because your memory fades in the blink of an eye? MemoryBlinkr is here to help â€“ a game where you only have until your next blink to remember an image or text and replicate it as accurately as possible.

## Inspiration
We wanted a chance to work with computer vision and game development, and since the final product is essentially a collection of minigames with a common theme, it was perfect for learning a variety of new systems.

## What it does
The project is a memory game where the user has to memorize something on the screen as quickly as possible, as it disappears when they blink and they have to reproduce it. We implemented a few versions as individual minigames:
- Grid game: A grid of black and white squares appears on the screen. Each level gets harder as the grid size increases and the goal is to advance as far as possible.
- Image game: A random image appears on the screen and the goal is to replicate the image by drawing on a canvas.
- Phrase game: The player inputs a topic, which is used to generate a short sentence. The sentence is presented briefly and the goal is to reinput the phrase given.
